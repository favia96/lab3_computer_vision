# Computer Vision (DD2423) Lab. 3: Image Segmentation

Federico Favia & Martin De Pellegrini, December 2019, KTH, Stockholm

This project in Matlab developed within the course of Computer Vision at KTH investigates different image segmentation techniques such as K-means, mean-shift, normalized cut and graph cuts. Comments on the theory and the performances are made as well. See the report for more information.
Below an image example of the results obtained through Mean-shift:
